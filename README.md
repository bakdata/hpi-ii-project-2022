# HPI information integration project SoSe 2022

This repository provides a code base for the information integration course in the summer semester of 2022. Below you
can find the documentation for setting up the project.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Install [Protobuf compiler (protoc)](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/). If you are using windows you can
  use [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-protocol-buffers-on-windows/)
- Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

## Architecture

![](architecture.png)

### RB Website

The [Registerbekanntmachung website](https://www.handelsregisterbekanntmachungen.de/index.php?aktion=suche) contains
announcements concerning entries made into the companies, cooperatives, and
partnerships registers within the electronic information and communication system. You can search for the announcements.
Each announcement can be requested through the link below. You only need to pass the query parameters `rb_id`
and `land_abk`. For instance, we chose the state Rheinland-Pfalz `rp` with an announcement id of `56267`, the
new entry of the company BioNTech.

```shell
export STATE="rp" 
export RB_ID="56267"
curl -X GET  "https://www.handelsregisterbekanntmachungen.de/skripte/hrb.php?rb_id=$RB_ID&land_abk=$STATE"
```

### RB Crawler

The Registerbekanntmachung crawler (rb_crawler) sends a get request to the link above with parameters (`rb_id`
and `land_abk`) passed to it and extracts the information from the response.

We use [Protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
to define our [schema](./proto/bakdata/corporate/v1/corporate.proto).

The crawler uses the generated model class (i.e., `Corporate` class) from
the [protobuf schema](./proto/bakdata/corporate/v1/corporate.proto).
We will explain furthur how you can generate this class using the protobuf compiler.
The compiler creates a `Corporate` class with the fields defined in the schema. The crawler fills the object fields with
the
extracted data from the website.
It then serializes the `Corporate` object to bytes so that Kafka can read it and produces it to the `corporate-events`
topic. After that, it increments the `rb_id` value and sends another GET request.
This process continues until the end of the announcements is reached, and the crawler will stop automatically.

### corporate-events topic

The `corporate-events` holds all the events (announcements) produced by the `rb_crawler`. Each message in a Kafka topic
consist of a key and value.

The key type of this topic is `String`. The key is generated by the `rb_crawler`. The key
is a combination of the `land_abk` and the `rb_id`. If we consider the `rb_id` and `land_abk` from the example above,
the
key will look like this: `rp_56267`.

The value of the message contains more information like `event_name`, `event_date`, and more. Therefore, the value type
is complex and needs a schema definition.

### Kafka Connect

[Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html) is a tool to move large data sets into
(source) and out (sink) of Kafka.
Here we only use the Sink connector, which consumes data from a Kafka topic into a secondary index such as
Elasticsearch.

We use the [Elasticsearch Sink Connector](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connect-elasticsearch/current/overview.html)
to move the data from the `coporate-events` topic into the Elasticsearch.

## Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a build tool.
To install all the dependencies, just run `poetry install`.

This project uses Protobuf for serializing and deserializing objects. We provided a
simple [protobuf schema](./proto/bakdata/corporate/v1/corporate.proto).
Furthermore, you need to generate the Python code for the model class from the proto file.
To do so run the [`generate-proto.sh`](./generate-proto.sh) script.
This script uses the [Protobuf compiler (protoc)](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) to generate the model class
under the `build/gen/bakdata/corporate/v1` folder
with the name `corporate_pb2.py`.

## Run

### Infrastructure

Use `docker-compose up -d` to start all the services: [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)
, [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Schema
Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html)
, [Kafka REST Proxy]((https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-rest)), [Kowl](https://github.com/redpanda-data/kowl),
[Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html),
and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/). Depending on your system, it takes a couple of minutes
before the services are up and running. You can use a tool
like [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker)
to check the status of the services.

### Kafka Connect

After all the services are up and running, you need to configure Kafka Connect to use the Elasticsearch sink connector.
The config file is a JSON formatted file. We provided a [basic configuration file](./connect/elastic-sink.json).
You can find more information about the configuration properties on
the [official documentation page](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connect-elasticsearch/current/overview.html).

To start the connector, you need to push the JSON config file to Kafka. You can either use the UI dashboard in Kowl or
use the [bash script provided](./connect/push-config.sh). It is possible to remove a connector by deleting it
through Kowl's UI dashboard or calling the deletion API in the [bash script provided](./connect/delete-config.sh).

### RB Crawler

You can start the crawler with the command below:

```shell
poetry run python rb_crawler/main.py --id $RB_ID --state $STATE
```

The `--id` option is an integer, which determines the initial event in the handelsregisterbekanntmachungen to be
crawled.

The `--state` option takes a string (only the ones listed above). This string defines the state where the crawler should
start from.

You can use the `--help` option to see the usage:

```
Usage: main.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -i, --id INTEGER                The rb_id to initialize the crawl from
  -s, --state [bw|by|be|br|hb|hh|he|mv|ni|nw|rp|sl|sn|st|sh|th]
                                  The state ISO code
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Query data

### Kowl

[Kowl](https://github.com/redpanda-data/kowl) is a web application that helps you manage and debug your Kafka workloads
effortlessly. You can create, update, and delete Kafka resources like Topics and Kafka Connect configs.
You can see Kowl's dashboard in your browser under http://localhost:8080.

### Elasticsearch

To query the data from Elasticsearch, you can use
the [query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl.html) of elastic. For example:

```shell
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            <field>
        }
    }
}
'
```

`<field>` is the field you wish to search. For example:

```
"reference_id":"HRB 41865"
```

## Teardown
You can stop and remove all the resources by running:
```shell
docker-compose down
```
